### Desktop updates:
* installed a video player `sudo apt install mvp`
* installed a disk manager via `audo apt install gnome-disk-utility` which can be opened via `gnome-disks`
	* fuck this, formated the 6TB drive to ext4 via gparted and mounted it in `/home/hisfantor/internal`
	* gave me all rights on the disk via `sudo chmod 777 /home/hisfantor/internal`
	* started transfer of 1.1TB of movies, with a current write speed of 73MB/s

#### Workshop PC:
* checked Solidworks instalation -> all good for now

#### Notebook:
* I used my google drive via a server connection in nautilus, but I couldn't live edit an html file so I wanted to use `google-drive-ocamlfuse`
* had some trouble installing it the usual way like described [here](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/04/mount-google-drive-ocamlfuse-linux)
* I found the ppa on [here](https://launchpad.net/~alessandro-strada/+archive/ubuntu/google-drive-ocamlfuse-beta/+build/15331130) and downloaded the .deb manually
* then installed it via `sudo dpkg -i /path/to/deb/file && sudo apt-get install -f`
* also included `exec_always google-drive-ocamlfuse ~/googledrive` in my i3 config

### Pi Calendar:
* introduction of a second led and loop functions
* I had enough of the visual programing in Sketch and switched to python on the commandline
* make sure you have `python-rpi.gpio` installed

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO 		
#improting the GPIO functions
import time						
#time for pauses between steps

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)			
#that's the method how to assign the pins
GPIO.setup(24, GPIO.OUT)		
# use the pins as out
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)		
#I used the same pins as the calendar

t = 0.5 						
#varable for timing(t in s)

def dot():					
# I used the two LEDs to make a little morse code
# dot/short is the first LED
	GPIO.output(24, GPIO.HIGH)	
	time.sleep(t)
	GPIO.output(24, GPIO.LOW)
	time.sleep(t)

def dash():						
#dash/long is the second LED
	GPIO.output(18, GPIO.HIGH)
	time.sleep(t)
	GPIO.output(18, GPIO.LOW)
	time.sleep(t)

def stop():						
#in between letters both LEDs light up
	GPIO.output(24, GPIO.HIGH)
	GPIO.output(18, GPIO.HIGH)
	time.sleep(t)
	GPIO.output(24, GPIO.LOW)
	GPIO.output(18, GPIO.LOW)
	time.sleep(t)

dot()
dash()
dot()
dash()
stop()

dot()
dot()
stop()

dot()
stop()

#...

GPIO.cleanup()					
#stes back all the GPIO settings and turns everything off
```
* that's my first code in Python ever and I really like it, its conda confusing that a function block is defined by tabs and not curly brackets
* also it's awesome experimenting with the GPIO pins, all the potential it brings to the table!
