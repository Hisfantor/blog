### Desktop updates:
* installed spotify with: `sudo snap install spotify`
* Trying to install nvidia drivers... freeze while rebooting
	* while booting enter GRUB with `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`Del`
		* or `F12` to get into bootorder and chose UEF
	* Advanced options -> Recovery mode -> root
	* might have to remount filesystem first `mount -o rw,remount /`
	* delete the drivers with `apt purge nvidia*`
	* `reboot` 
* copiing files from old SSD to External 4TB (and started full backup on 6TB drive)
	* `sudo fdisk -l` to show all drives
	* `mkdir /home/<username>/<folder for drive>` to create a folder to mount to
	* `sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/<partition name> /home/<username>/<folder for drive>`
	* `sudo umount /dev/<partition name>` unmount drive if you need it  

### Pi Calendar
* installation of Raspbian
	* SSD full -> format usb to get stuff of with `gnome-disks`
	* or just fucking use your notebook to download the OS
	* make bootable USB with `usb-creator-gtk`
* updates(automatically) and I installed `nautilus`
* downloaded files from http://bit.ly/c-adventskalender-raspberry-pi-18
* could't find the right resistor so I used a red LED wich actually uses 3.3V
* held it up to the pins (1(3.3V) and 6(gnd)) and it glows, yey
