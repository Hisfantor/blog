### prepare the pi
- download the rpi-imager from [the raspberrypi website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)
- write rasbian lite to your sd-card(at least 4Gb)

#### on windows
- Control Panel > Programs > Turn Windows Features On Or Off. Enable the “Windows Subsystem for Linux” 

![windows settings]() 

- install ubuntu from the microsoft store

![microsoft store ubuntu]()
- start "Ubuntu" let it install and set your password(I'd recommand the same as you'll use on your pi) and username
- `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
- mount the SD card to enable SSH:
```
sudo mkdir /mnt/d
sudo mount -t drvfs D: /mnt/d
cd /mnt/d
```

#### the rest via Linux

- create an "ssh" file (no extension) under the boot partition:
- `vi ssh`
- type `:wq` and hit enter

- now you can put the SD in your pi, connect ethernet(CAT5.e recommandet) and finnaly plug in power
- after boot use `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local`
- password: raspberry

![ssh login]()

- use `ifconfig` to see the PI's mac adress

![ifconfig from pi]()

- set static ip via your router
- reboot pi


- `ssh pi@<your ip>`
- optional `sudo raspi-config` to change your password
- `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
- now the actuall install:
- `curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash`
- keep all of the preset preferences 
- take a screenshot of the finish page with the ip and your password to the analytics
- type `exit` hit enter, to get out of the ssh connection

### set the new DNS Server
#### ubuntu
sudo vi /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
sudo netplan apply

#### android

#### windows
