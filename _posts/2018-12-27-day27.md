### Notebook

#### nvidia drivers<sup>1</sup>
* I always did it like [here](http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/how-to-install-latest-nvidia-drivers-in-linux)
* but now I always get `E: Unable to locate package nvidia-410`
* so I opend `Software and Updates` via cmd with `sudo software-properties-gtk`
* first I deleted all the graphics drivers ppas in `other software`
* but then also installed the driver via this tool in the `additional drivers` tab
* reboot
* checked for the install by opening `$``nvidia-settings`
* it schould look something like this:
![nvidia settings](https://i.imgur.com/RaLr3dD.png)
* or just use `lsmod | grep nvidia` and if you get an output the driver has sucessfully installed

#### CPU temp<sup>2</sup>
* my notebook freezes from time to time and even SysRq shortcuts won't help 
* I have to look further into it but for now I installed `lm-sensors`
* `sudo apt-get install lm-sensors` 
* start it with `sudo sensors-detect` accept everything with yes
* run `sensors` to see the temps
* output:

```bash
hisfantor@ ~ () $ sensors
coretemp-isa-0000
Adapter: ISA adapter
Package id 0:  +62.0°C  (high = +100.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)
Core 0:        +51.0°C  (high = +100.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)
Core 1:        +51.0°C  (high = +100.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)
Core 2:        +54.0°C  (high = +100.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)
Core 3:        +62.0°C  (high = +100.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)

acpitz-virtual-0
Adapter: Virtual device
temp1:        +62.0°C  (crit = +105.0°C)

iwlwifi-virtual-0
Adapter: Virtual device
temp1:        +42.0°C  

pch_skylake-virtual-0
Adapter: Virtual device
temp1:        +45.0°C  

```
* don't know why high and crit aren't working properly but whatever

#### jekyll error<sup>3</sup>
* got this while testing locally

```bash
Liquid Exception: no implicit conversion of Float into String in /_layouts/post.html
jekyll 3.8.1 | Error:  no implicit conversion of Float into String

```
* the problem was that I used the date as my post title:

```
