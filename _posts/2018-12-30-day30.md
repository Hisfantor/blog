### Desktop updates:

### Notebook:

#### windows fucked up my external drive
* used my external drive on a friends PC under windows
* after that I couldn't even mount the drive and got the following error:
![Error mounting filesystem](https://i.imgur.com/Q1ydJzu.png)
* the error is kinda helpful but not really
* what I did(and worked for me):
* boot into windows and check the drive letter
* open cmd as admin
* `chkdsk /F d:` (d is the drive letter)
* this command checks and repairs the NTFS filesystem

### mobile:
fing ssh
