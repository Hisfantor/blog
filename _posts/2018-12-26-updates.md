### Desktop updates:
* installed:

```bash
gpicview		#picture viewer
evince			#pdf viewer
lxappearance		#gtk styling and iconpack
```

### Notebook:

#### remounting with read write rights
* I booted into windows via the external SSD and searched for a file on my second internal disk
* than went back to linux and had no writing rights on this drive, the following command solved it:
* `sudo mount -o remount,rw '/media/hisfantor/data/'`
* in which `/media/hisfantor/data/` is my mount point 

#### rubiks cube
* he wrote a program to simmulate a rubiks cube with variable size
* the program can simulate and solve cubes up to 101x101x101 (your PC hardware is the limiting factor)
* video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM2czqavlWM>
* code: <https://github.com/Code-Bullet/RubiksCubeAI>
* IDE: <https://processing.org/download/>
* `L` to rotate the cube with your mouse `space` to start/stop scrambling/solving

#### git branches<sup>1</sup>

```bash
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
$ git commit -am "msg"
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```
#### git prompt<sup>2</sup>
* download it [here](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh) and put it in a file in your home directory
* `~/.git-prompt.sh`
* then open your `~/.bashrc` and put in:

```bash
source ~/.git-prompt.sh
export PS1="\[\033[36m\]\u\[\033[m\]@\[\033[32m\] \[\033[33;1m\]\w\[\033[m\] (\$(git branch 2>/dev/nul    l | grep '^*' | colrm 1 2)) \$ "
```
* the second line will change your command-line prompt to:
* `[user]@ [file path] ([git branch]) $`

#### pulseaudio shortcuts<sup>3</sup>
* first I recognised that pavucontrol and pulseaudio are the same thing... I thought they were different because my soundkeys stopped working when I opend pavucontrol
* my old settings:

```bash
bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec --no-startup-id pactl set-sink-volume 0 +5% #increase sound volume4 
bindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec --no-startup-id pactl set-sink-volume 0 -5% #decrease sound volume 
bindsym XF86AudioMute exec --no-startup-id pactl set-sink-mute 0 toggle # mute sound
```
new settings:

```bash
bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec --no-startup-id amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%+ #increase sound volume
bindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec --no-startup-id amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%- #decrease sound volume
bindsym XF86AudioMute exec --no-startup-id amixer -D pulse set Master 1+ toggle # mute sound
```
`alsamixer`
* seems to work great (all in my `~/config/i3/config`)
