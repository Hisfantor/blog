### Desktop updates:
* added some characters from the german keyboard layout that I'm missing using the american one so I created the file `.Xmodmap` in the home directory
```
keycode 108 = Mode_switch Multi_key
keycode 38 = a A adiaeresis Adiaeresis
keycode 39 = s S ssharp ssharp
keycode 30 = u U udiaeresis Udiaeresis
keycode 32 = o O odiaeresis Odiaeresis
keycode 49 = asciitilde grave degree 
keycode 11 = 2 at twosuperior
keycode 12 = 3 numbersign threesuperior
keycode 26 = e E EuroSign
keycode 27 = r R registered
keycode 21 = equal plus plusminus
```
* to activat it just run `xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap`
* I wrote this file innitially for my notebook but it works great on my custoum mechanical keyboard as well

### Pi Calendar:
* Mission is to do it all with python from now on, but now the introduced graphics so let's see
* first I had to install `graphics.py` I got the code from [here](http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py) and placed the file in `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages`
* also had to install Tkinter via `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
* installed `pygame` with [this](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/CompileUbuntu?parent=) instructions
* drew an image and a box but I cant check these for collision so I have to change to sprites tomorrow
