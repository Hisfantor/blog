### Desktop updates:
* uploaded day1 and made some tweaks to older posts, trying to figure out the problem with the tables
	* do to all the testing I use `git add -A && git commit -m 'day one8' && git push` to create posts in one line, the `&&` waits for the first command to finish
	* my mistake was that I didn't hat a free line between the header and the table...
	* fucked up the backup from yesterday so I had to start over again...

### Pi Calendar
* connected the red LED to pins 6(gnd) and 12(GPIO18) 
* Started the preinstalled program Sctretch
* opened the file 02led02
* tweked the delay, added an other blink and a delay in between
* run the program with the green flag in the top right corner
