## PC stuff:
### Desktop updates:
* I started using the latest Ubuntu server version in the attempt to build a slim OS to use on any system
* I use I3 as my window manager 
* but ince then I ecperienced some random crashes and freezes and the beautiful "Aw, Snap! Something went wrong..." in chromium, not sure why

#### Blog:
* `jekyll s --unpublished`
* just to run the jekyll server with unpublished posts included

### Notebook:
* ocamlfuse fucks with me and I have to remount it after each reboot 

#### boot via external SSD:
* I used an PCB of an external HDD( which I took apart to place the HDD in my Desktop) and put my old SSD in
* connected it to power and via USB(3.0)
* went into my BIOS(pressing F2 at startup) and enabled USB boot (boot mode: legacy)
* restart and into the bootmenu(pressing F12) choose the external disk(under USB)
* it booted right into the UEFI menu with options for Ubuntu and Windows
* since I tested this to use windows without having it on the main PC drives I started it

#### had to update the graphics drivers:
* uninstalled everything nvida related
* reboot
* got the lates drivers for my mx150 from nvidias website
* ran the installer
* reboot
* everything fine, card is recognised in the device and task manager(same with CPU, all disks and wifi card)

## Raspberry plesure:
### Pi Calendar:
* I checked out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Idu8XfwKUao) to learn about sprite collision detection in python to work on day4
* so I started using pygame as well
* it's already working but I want to make it nice

### Pi Zero:
* first setup ever
* I found a micro to mini USB which allowed me to connect my keyboard(otherwise I wouldn't had been able to communicate with the Pi zero thanks to his inconvinient micro usb port placement)
* only thing to mention with the setup is that you have to press `space` to check a box in the setup 

#### SSH:
#### on the Pi(host):
* open terminal `Ctrl + Alt + T`
* `sudo systemctl enable ssh`
* `sudo systemctl start ssh`

#### on your PC(client):
* `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local` 
* because we haven't changed the pi's name there will be a warning like:

```
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@       WARNING: POSSIBLE DNS SPOOFING DETECTED!          @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
The ECDSA host key for raspberrypi.local has changed,
and the key for the corresponding IP address 192.168.0.200
is unknown. This could either mean that
DNS SPOOFING is happening or the IP address for the host
and its host key have changed at the same time.

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the ECDSA key sent by the remote host is
SHA256:5FuzlLJo30I3uGNK1uRcieL4H776KeWzmz3aNyrzzDk.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /home/hisfantor/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending ECDSA key in /home/hisfantor/.ssh/known_hosts:17
  remove with:
  ssh-keygen -f "/home/hisfantor/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "raspberrypi.local"
ECDSA host key for raspberrypi.local has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.

```

* so just do what it tells you `ssh-keygen -f "/home/hisfantor/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "raspberrypi.local"`
* then SSH again and type in the password which I have chosen while setting up the Pi
